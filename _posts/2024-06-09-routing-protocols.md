# Introduction
Without a way to route traffic, roads would be a mess. Imagine using a map application to get to a place that you've never been to before. You start out at your house just fine, but as soon as you get the intersection that leads out of your neighborhood, the app has no idea where to take you next. That's networking without routing protocols. Routing protocols are a fundamental aspect of networking, and knowing about how they work and how to implement them is all but required for any network engineering job (although it's nice to know in general).

In each of the following sections, I'll present a routing protocol. Then, I'll give a brief description of how it works, and how to implement it on a Cisco IOS device.
